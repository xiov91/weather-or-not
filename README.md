# weather-or-not

While I had a lot more time to dedicate to this challenge, I didn't get as far as I'd like. In particular, this looks like trash. I'll be the first to admit it. But I got nearly every other important component either finished or started. I'm honestly pretty proud of how far I got in this one with pretty minimal help. While I'm never opposed to assitance, I'm aiming to be independently knowledgable about this stuff, and I feel like I really got a step closer to that goal with this challenge. :)
